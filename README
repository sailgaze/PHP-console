PHP Console (all self-contained within index.php) is a handy script to test and run your PHP code snippets.
Instead of struggling with "php -a" (that usually doesn't work on Windows at all) you can just put index.php file somewhere 
on your local WEB server space and access it via:

http://localhost/index.php

This script will run your PHP snippets and show generated output.
